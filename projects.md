# Creative Projects
- [Flow Lines](./flow_lines) : Particle simulation using trigonometric flow fields, generating dynamic visual patterns through mathematical transformations of particle trajectories.
- [Staggered Grid](./staggered_grid) : Responsive web grid with interactive tile animations. Creates dynamic visual interactions through smooth opacity transitions and animated backgrounds.
- [Matrix Rain](./matrix_rain) : Generative visualization simulating dynamic symbol rainfall using procedural animation and canvas rendering. Like the Matix movie ;)
