Most of these projects work best on a desktop environment.

## Creative Projects
- [Flow Lines](./flow_lines) : Particle simulation using trigonometric flow fields, generating dynamic visual patterns through mathematical transformations of particle trajectories.
- [Staggered Grid](./staggered_grid) : Responsive web grid with interactive tile animations. Creates dynamic visual interactions through smooth opacity transitions and animated backgrounds.
- [Matrix Rain](./matrix_rain) : Generative visualization simulating dynamic symbol rainfall using procedural animation and canvas rendering. Like the Matrix movie ;)

## Games
- [Guess My Number](./guessnum) : A simple game of guessing the number between 1 and 20.
- [Pig game](./piggame) : A fun and interactive two-player dice game where players take turns rolling dice to accumulate points.

## Misc
- [urloong](https://urloong.com/): a full-stack URL “longener” that turns any link into a comically endless chain of characters using Next.js, Express, and Supabase.
- [Bankist](./bankist): A minimalist banking prototype—just a fun way to build my web development skills!. I also wrote a couple Medium articles explaining the working of this project check [here](https://singhdan.medium.com/bankist-when-banking-meets-minimalist-bba5635496d4) and [here](https://singhdan.medium.com/bankist-app-645672a50ae6)
