I'm a senior year Computer Science undergraduate student advised by 
[Dr. Filippo Menczer ](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil) at 
[Observatory On Social Media at Indiana Univeristy(OSoMe@IU)](https://osome.iu.edu/). 
I previously worked with [Dr. David Crandall](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/djcran/) 
at [IU Computer Vision Lab](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/).

I’m really into social media analysis, especially around topics like misinformation and how information spreads. I’ve got a bit of a unique angle since I focus on the computer vision side of things, which makes analyzing different types of media(image, audio, video) super interesting for me. I love doing research because it’s a way to help inform the public and tackle some of the challenges we face in the digital world.
