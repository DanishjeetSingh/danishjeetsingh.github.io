## Waterdrop 
*January 25th, 2025*

Just a simple waterdrop made in Procreate, wasn't really hard to be honest. I'm finally learning to use Procreate. Its an amazing app I must say!
I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqyYDjADkOo), it taught me the basics of Procreate and reminded me of basic optical Physics.
