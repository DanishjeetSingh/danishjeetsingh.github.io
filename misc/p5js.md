## Here's me expressing some creativity through code.

- **[Generative Trees](https://editor.p5js.org/danishjeetsingh/sketches/8q0nupVJn)** - A generative tree sketch that creates randomized fractal branches with varying lengths and angles.
- **[Hue Shifted Interactive Square](https://editor.p5js.org/danishjeetsingh/sketches/MpSsahVhe)** - An interactive sketch where background and square colors shift with mouse movement, creating dynamic hue contrasts. *epilepsy warning*
